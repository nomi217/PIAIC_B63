# LangChain Projects

### What is LangChain?
LangChain is an open-source framework designed for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions to handle various components of generative AI applications, such as:

- Prompt Engineering: Modular templates for prompt creation.
- Chains: Combining multiple steps or calls to LLMs and other tools into sequences for complex workflows.
- Agents: Enabling dynamic decision-making where LLMs can decide which tool, API, or action to invoke.
- Tooling Integration: Interfaces with external tools like databases, APIs, or custom code execution (e.g., Python, Google Search, or SQL).
- Memory: Maintaining state or context across user interactions for multi-turn conversations.
- Document Retrieval: Integrating with vector databases or search systems for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.

LangChain simplifies the orchestration of various components required to create generative AI-powered applications, enabling developers to focus on high-level design rather than low-level integration details.
